# EEPROMProgammer



# Circuit
This is a simple circuit for programming the **AT28C64 EEPROM** using an **Arduino Nano**. Since the Arduino doesn't have enough pins to directly control all the data and address pins of the EEPROM, this design utilizes two **74HC595** serial-in parallel-out shift register chips to cummunicate with the EEPROM.

# What's here?

# 1. Basic progammer
The code in the [code/eeprom-progammer.ino](https://github.com/OmerMaruani/Board-Design-PCB/blob/main/code/eeprom-progammer.ino)
is a simple EEPROM programmer. It writes a few bytes into the EEPROM and then reads its contents.
